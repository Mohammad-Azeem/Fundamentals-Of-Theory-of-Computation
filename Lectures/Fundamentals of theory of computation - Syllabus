Course description: Introductory course for computational theory.
 
Student Learning Outcomes: The student knows and can apply the general and specific mathematical, computing principles, facts, rules, relationships, and procedures that underpin the knowledge of the IT specialty.
 
Expectations and Resources for Student Success: 
No more than 3 missed practices AND
2 successful tests, the total number of points reaching the minimum level of mark 2.

In case of a missed or unsuccessful test, the student has an opportunity to retake one or both of the tests. A successful test may also be retaken in hope of a better grade.
 
Course Management and Policies: Any kind of cooperation of students during the practice tests (unless clearly otherwise stated in the text of the exercise) is strictly prohibited and can result disqualification from the test.


 
Assignments and Assessment Methods:

Assignment, Assessment or activity	Percentage of grade or points	Due date
  midterm test     	50% 	2022-10-11
 endterm test	 50%	2022-11-24
 	 	 
 	 	 
           	 	 
 	 	 
 	 	 
 	 	 
                                                                                                                       
Course Grading For both tests a minimum of 30% of points needed to be declared successful. Grading is based on total points.  Less than 40%: mark 1, at least 40%, but less than 55%: mark 2, at least 55%, but less than 70%: mark 3, at least 70%, but less than 85%: mark 4, at least 85%: mark 5.
